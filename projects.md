## Ping's Pokedex for Android

This project was to create an Android version of [Ping's Pokedex](https://sites.google.com/site/pingspokedex/).
The project supported numerous languages like English, Japanese, Chinese, German, etc.
Unfortunately, it was removed from the Google Play Store due to "Copyright Infringement."
Check out the repository to the old code [here](https://github.com/zackshank/pings-pokedex-android).
