Groovy is coming to Android! Using [CÃ©dric Champeau's Android Plugin][groovyAndroidPlugin], you can start building Android applications completely in Groovy! It still feels a little bit alpha-y, but this is just the beginning. Champeau and Spring is reaching out to the community to help build this platform. Maybe, I'll bring back Ping's Pokedex and do it completely in Groovy.
