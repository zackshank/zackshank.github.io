The internet used to be a pretty cool place growing up in the early aughts. It
was full of creativity and ingenuity. You could carve out your own little corner
and make it something
[truly unique.](http://www.wonder-tonic.com/geocitiesizer/content.php?theme=2&music=3&url=zpshank.github.io)
Looking back, as someone whose coming-of-age aligns with that of the internet, I
can't help but feel some magic and wonder has been lost.

Corporation's push to social media platforms has resulted in a homogenous
internet that can feel sterile and uninspired. Facebook has resulted in a
platform where like-minded individuals can join eachother's echo chambers
refusing to improve their media literacy skills. Twitter has devolved into a
platform which always seems to bubble the most controversial responses to the
top of the screen and its users have yet to realize meaningful conversations and
debates cannot occur in 144 characters or less. Finally, Myspace, a site which I
believe to have been one of the last bastions of self-expression (more on that
in a later post), has been reduced to total irrelevancy.

Enter POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere).

> Did you just double nest parenthesis?

Yup!

I believe the first step to reclaiming the internet from social media platforms
is for citizens of the web to start owning their own data. Create a site to
house all of your grandmother's famous recipes. Publish all of that Rugrats
fan-fic you've been hoarding. Or just write a blog to capture your daily
thoughts. Enter this blog.

I'm not really sure _what_ I'm doing. I just know I want to produce _something_.
My life is full of consumption. _What's the latest gaming news on reddit?_ _What
am I going to watch on Netflix tonight?_ _Let me browse the recent game deals so
I can buy games that I don't have time to play, because I'm too busy browsing
reddit._ I need to focus on _producing_, and I hope that this journal is the
start of that.
